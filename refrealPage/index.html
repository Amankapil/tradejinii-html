                                Over 60% of the clients are vulnerable to shift in a normal brokerage due to better offer
                                elsewhere. Almost 95% of clients under discount brokerage are retained and don’t switch loyalty.

                                provide an online form/link which will directly update the same on our back office. A lead will

                                Back office) this lead opens an account using the same mobile number and /or email id, he would
                                be treated as your client
