                            Over 60% of the clients are vulnerable to shift in a normal brokerage due to better offer
                            elsewhere. Almost 95% of clients under discount brokerage are retained and don’t switch
                            loyalty.

                            There is no limit on the number of clients who can be mapped to you. Given the incentive,

                            will mostly likely to bring in new referrals. As a general practice, the trader community is
                            well networked and once they see the benefit they will keep spreading the good message. So
                            in a
                            sense it is a self-propelling prophecy of strong referral. Since we are not in the business
                            of
                            advising clients there is all possibility they will only continue to trade through us

                                There is no limit on the number of clients who can be mapped to you. Given the

                                will mostly likely to bring in new referrals. As a general practice, the trader
                                community is
                                well networked and once they see the benefit they will keep spreading the good message.
                                So in a
                                sense it is a self-propelling prophecy of strong referral. Since we are not in the
